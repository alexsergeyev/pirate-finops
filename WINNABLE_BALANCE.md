## ‚úÖ Key Change: Savings Now Match or Exceed Waste Costs!

When you fix a resource, the monthly savings are **equal to or greater than** the waste cost, making every fix a net positive for your budget.

## üìä Balanced Resource Economics

| Resource | Waste/Turn | Fix Turns | Savings Range | Net Benefit |
|----------|------------|-----------|---------------|-------------|
| **Idle VM** | $100 | 2 | $100-120 | **+$0 to +$20** |
| **Orphaned Disk** | $25 | 1 | $25-35 | **+$0 to +$10** |
| **Overprovisioned AKS** | $200 | 3 | $200-250 | **+$0 to +$50** |
| **Unused Public IP** | $5 | 1 | $5-8 | **+$0 to +$3** |
| **Stale Snapshot** | $15 | 1 | $15-25 | **+$0 to +$10** |
| **Missed Reservation** | $150 | 3 | $150-200 | **+$0 to +$50** |
| **Log Ingestion** | $50 | 2 | $50-70 | **+$0 to +$20** |
| **Oversized App Service** | $80 | 2 | $80-110 | **+$0 to +$30** |

**Every fix reduces burn by its waste cost AND adds savings!**

## üéÆ Game Parameters (Normal Mode)

### Starting Conditions
- **Budget**: $25,000 (increased)
- **Base Burn**: $75/turn (reduced)
- **Resource Density**: 25% of tiles (~16 resources on 8x8)
- **Movement Cost**: $20 per move

### Expected Initial State
- **Total Waste**: ~$400-600 (16 resources averaging $40 each)
- **Initial Burn**: $75 + ~$500 = **~$575/turn**
- **Runway**: ~43 turns if nothing fixed

## üèÜ Win Conditions (Achievable!)

**Win if EITHER:**
- Waste ‚â§ 30% of total burn
- Monthly Savings ‚â• $2,000

### Path to Victory

#### Example: Fix 10 resources
```
Fixed Resources:
- 1 AKS: -$200 waste, +$225 savings
- 1 Reservation: -$150 waste, +$175 savings
- 2 VMs: -$200 waste, +$220 savings
- 2 App Services: -$160 waste, +$190 savings
- 4 Small items: -$100 waste, +$120 savings

Result:
- Waste reduced by: $810
- Savings gained: $930
- New burn: $75 + ($500 - $810) = $0 (negative waste impossible, so $75)
- Monthly savings: $930

After fixing more:
- Total savings: $2,100+ ‚Üí WIN!
```

## üí∞ Budget Timeline

```
Turn 0:  $25,000 (Start)
Turn 5:  ~$22,000 (Exploring, ~$575/turn)
Turn 10: ~$19,500 (Started fixing, ~$400/turn)
Turn 15: ~$17,500 (Major items fixed, ~$250/turn)
Turn 20: ~$16,000 (Near victory, ~$150/turn)
Turn 25: Victory with $15,000+ remaining!
```

## üéØ Winning Strategy

### Phase 1: Discovery (Turns 1-5)
- Scout the map efficiently
- Identify big items (AKS, Reservations, VMs)
- Budget: $25,000 ‚Üí ~$22,000

### Phase 2: Big Fixes (Turns 6-15)

- Fix Reservations ($150 ‚Üí $175 avg)
- Fix VMs ($100 ‚Üí $110 avg)
- Budget: ~$22,000 ‚Üí ~$17,000

## üéÆ Difficulty Levels

| Mode | Budget | Grid | Density | Base Burn | Challenge |
|------|--------|------|---------|-----------|-----------|
| Easy | $30,000 | 6x6 | 25% | $50 | Very Winnable |
| Normal | $25,000 | 8x8 | 25% | $75 | Balanced |
| Hard | $20,000 | 10x10 | 25% | $100 | Challenging |

## üí° Quick Math

### Initial State (Normal)
- Resources: ~16
- Average waste: $40 each
- Total waste: ~$640
- Initial burn: $75 + $640 = **$715/turn**

### After Fixing Half (8 resources)
- Waste removed: ~$320
- Savings gained: ~$400
- New burn: $75 + $320 = **$395/turn**
- Monthly savings: **$400**

### After Fixing Most (14 resources)
- Waste removed: ~$560
- Savings gained: ~$700
- New burn: $75 + $80 = **$155/turn**
- Monthly savings: **$700**

### Victory!
- Fix just 15-20 more resources
- Reach $2,000+ savings
- Win with 40%+ budget remaining

## üöÄ Success Tips
